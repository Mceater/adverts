Some of the thing we have implemented that may require constant use of is mongodb and things such as the paypal. Updates would need to be required for constant use of the paypal api and to be able to use the mongodb database certain things such as the environment variables would need to be used, otherwise data won't render. The data has to render for the application to work.
