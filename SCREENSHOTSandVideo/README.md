This is the entry point for the website and the main screen for the application which shows all the ads for all the companies. It shows an amount of ads that are randomly put in different places around the screen. When you scroll you can see different adds. Clicking on an add will go to the brands website. There is also a filtering section that allows ads to be filtered by either popular categories or by typing in an input that will dynamically show different categories as the user is typing.
