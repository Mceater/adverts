//Outline of the application
The application we are aiming to build is suppose to be a ad service for any individual or group that wants to promote their brands to our website. When they create
an account, to get a add to display they will pay a service through paypal to get their add on the screen. In addition, any person that creates an account to our website is
offered a shortner url service.
The target audience that we are trying to appeal to is companies that have their own websites and want a place free from ad blocks.
The data source we have used in this application is mongodb.
